Looking for an opportunity to connect with students and faculty sharing similar interests and experience in program planning and mentoring? Become a House Leader for one of seven Living Learning Communities! 

These communities expand to cover a wide range of academic disciplines such as engineering, health, business, and honors. Living Learning Communities provide a unique opportunity for you to live and learn with other NIU students who have common academic interests. You will be able to connect to faculty, engage in hands-on learning experiences through field trips and career-related activities, and much more!

As a House Leader, you will be expected to help create educational programming and network with faculty, alumni, and other professionals. Past events have included trips to the Paramount Theater, Top Golf, Chicago Architectural Museum, and Mercy Hospital. House leaders  play an integral role in nurturing a residential learning community among residents and to connect students to the college. This is an opportunity for business career house leaders to bridge the gap between classroom learning, living environments, and real-world application. Another benefit to being a House Leader is living in the residence halls for FREE.
