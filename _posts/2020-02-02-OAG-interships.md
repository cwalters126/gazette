The Illinois Office of the Auditor General is looking for OM&IS interns.


The Illinois Office of the Auditor General is once again looking to fill entry-level and internship vacancies in the Springfield Office. Students majoring in accounting may be interested in Auditor I vacancies. Students majoring in computer science, management information systems, data analytics, or a similar field will hopefully consider Information Specialist I vacancies. For those not graduating in 2020, the Office also offers paid internships to students pursing a variety of different majors.
