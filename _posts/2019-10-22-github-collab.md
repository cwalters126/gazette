Join the InspirEd Lab team members for an introduction to Git and GitHub, where you will learn GitHub best practices to collaborate.

### Use GitHub to Collaborate:
The GitHub platform is an incredibly powerful collaboration tool. Anyone can collaborate on projects using GitHub! In this workshop, participants will create an account, become familiar with the GitHub platform, and use a best practice collaboration workflow to add their hometown to a map of all Localhost participants!

### Set up Git Locally:
Many developers choose to use Git locally on their own computers. Once participants have had the chance to edit the project in the browser, theyâ€™ll learn how to do the same thing to a project locally.

### Learning Objectives:
- Use GitHub to collaborate on a project
- Learn important Git terminology
- Understand Git and collaboration best practices

### Requirements / Prerequisites:
- Participants will need to be able to create a GitHub account. This workshop can be completed entirely in the browser.
