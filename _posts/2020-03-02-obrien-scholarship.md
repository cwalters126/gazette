The O’Brien-Vrba Scholarship Trust is providing renewable scholarships to college upperclassmen and graduate students who attended high school or currently live in rural Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan communities.

Applicants must be collegiate juniors, seniors or graduate level students who are actively involved in school activities and community service, and who have a minimum grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale (or its equivalent). To be eligible, students must currently live or have resided during high school in a rural county in one of the states listed above. Please see the list of eligible rural counties here, as compiled by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy. (Applicants who attended high school in DeKalb County, Illinois, shall be considered to have fulfilled the rural residency requirement.) Applicants of the Catholic faith are encouraged.

Recipients of the O’Brien-Vrba Scholarship must be planning to enroll in full-time postsecondary or postgraduate study for the entire upcoming academic year; the scholarship may be renewable for one additional year or until a degree is earned, whichever occurs first.
