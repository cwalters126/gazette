Marketing and OMIS have tied for first place in a department wide homecoming window decorating contest! Marketing has been selected for their homecoming spirited window, and OMIS for their creativity.
Thank you to those that helped out, and congratulations OM&IS students on picking one of the best majors in the college of business!
