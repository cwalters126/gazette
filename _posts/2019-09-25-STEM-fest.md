Volunteers needed for the 10th Annual NIU STEM Fest on October 19, 2019! Use the link below to volunteer and collect passport credit!

STEM Fest is a free community event that packs NIUâ€™s Convocation Center with hands-on interactive exhibits, activities, and competitions to help k-12 students, their families, and the community, to explore science, technology, engineering, and math. People of all ages have fun while learning more about STEM careers and innovations. We count on NIU student volunteers to provide a positive experience for everyone who participates in STEM Fest.

STEM fest will need students to help with everything from greeting visitors, to event set-up and tear-down, to working at one of the interactive displays, during a shift of the students choosing. STEM fest relies on students to make this a fun and successful day for the community!

Students can sign up to volunteer <a href="https://stemfest.niu.edu/stemfest/volunteer/student-volunteers/index.shtml">here</a>.

Questions can be directed to Sara Finnigan via <a href="mailto: sfinnigan@niu.edu">email</a>, or call 815-753-1272.
