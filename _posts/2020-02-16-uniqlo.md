Apply for UNIQLO's Global Managment Program and go to Tokyo Japan the summer 2020 to learn the ins and outs of global retail.

Business students can learn about the UNIQLO Global Management Program (GMP), a five-day intensive business study program, which will be held in Tokyo from July 6 through 10. Students selected for the GMP program are provided with a unique opportunity to visit UNIQLO’s head offices and stores, while taking part in business sessions with market specialists, learning more about the industry and business. UNIQLO covers the participants’ flight and accommodation expenses, along with a set amount for meals during the stay.
