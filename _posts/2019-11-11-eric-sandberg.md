National Tool and Manufacturing Co has an opening that might be the perfect opportunity for a recent or December OM&IS Grad!

The position would both forecast and allocate raw material, coordinate with foreign steel mill suppliers, and analyze shop production for both scheduling and costing data. 

National Tool and Manufacturing Co is located at 563 Rock Road Drive, East Dundee, IL 60118.

If interested, reach out to Eric Sandberg, President of National Tool and Manufacturing Co, via <a href="mailto: ejsandberg@ntm.com">email</a>.
