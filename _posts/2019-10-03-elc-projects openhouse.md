Are you interested in having the opportunity to serve as a consultant and work directly with the leaders of organizations on real-world business issues?
The Experiential Learning Center will be hosting its open house October 17th. This open house is a passport event that allows students to learn more about the ELC project process. Representatives from each team will be on hand to share an overview of their project and the company they are serving, their experience working with a real-world organization, and will provide a brief overview of the projects for Spring 2020.

They will also be conducting interviews during the open house for those interested.

#### How to Apply:
