Build your first website using HTML/CSS and deploy it so others can find you and your work! This event will be held on Monday, November 18th in room BH 303 at 3:30 pm.

#### About this Workshop:

During this workshop, participants will be taught the structure and syntax of basic HTML and CSS. Participants will receive a skeleton of a portfolio website and will update the HTML to include information about themselves and edit the CSS to style and position elements on their page! Then, they’ll deploy their new website.

#### HTML & CSS:

HTML is the skeleton of every website on the internet and nearly all websites use CSS for styling. Learning HTML and CSS is the first step toward building a personal website, becoming more technically fluent, or beginning a career in web development or design!

#### Deployment:

While learning to edit HTML elements and CSS properties is an important first step toward making a website, there are more steps to getting a website publicly available on the internet. In this workshop, participants will use a simple deployment tool to get their website live before they leave!

#### Learning Objectives:
· Structure and Syntax of HTML & CSS

· Common HTML elements

· Important CSS properties

· Deploy Your Portfolio Site

#### Requirements / Information:
Participants will be required to have a computer that can connect to the Internet and run the following software:

· MacOS, Linux, or Windows 8 or higher

This workshop is designed for absolute beginners! There are no prerequisites.
