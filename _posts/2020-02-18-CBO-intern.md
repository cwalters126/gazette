CBO's 2020 Summer Internship Program is accepting applications. This is a unique paid program that allows master's and PhD students to obtain real-life experience in policymaking and the federal budget process. Students can view information about projects completed by last year's cohort <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/about/careers/internships">here</a>. CBO seeks students pursuing degrees in economics, public policy, public affairs, health policy, finance and other quantitative fields. Students should submit a cover letter indicating their skills for and interest in an internship, a resume, unofficial copy of transcripts (first-year graduate students MUST also submit an unofficial copy of their undergraduate transcripts), and contact information for 2 references (preferably an employment and academic) at www.cbo.gov/careers no later than Friday, February 28 EST . Applications received after the deadline will not be considered.

CBO can consider US citizens and noncitizens who are permanent residents of the US seeking citizenship.
