The Women’s Leadership Institute is hosting Women at the Table, a “speed networking” roundtable event to discuss important topics around women in business today. Alumni from across programs (and decades) will be on hand to lead discussion and network with students.

Although the audience is usually mostly women, men are invited to view the business world through a different lens.

RSVP soon, seats are 2/3 full!
Please RSVP <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXLWmP0pF73JCGWOoarxvS9xTwBOEiv0DvXOGLxkZrIswzTA/viewform">here</a>.
